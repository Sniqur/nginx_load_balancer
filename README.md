# Nginx Load Balancer

## Decription

This is my pet project I made  to train and brush up on my knowledge about Nginx. I decided to host website I found on the Internet and also used a self-signed certificate for it. Firstly I span up 3 docker containers on which Nginx will send traffic. After that I configured nginx.conf to listen all the traffic on port 8080 and send all the requests on three docker containers using `Round Robin` method (default method).
